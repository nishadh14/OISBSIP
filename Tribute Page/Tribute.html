        <b>Childhood and Education: </b><br><br>

        <p>Mr. Kalam was born on 15th October 1931 in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. He was born to Jainulabdeen a boat
            owner and an Imam at a local mosque and his wife Ashiamma. Kalam was the youngest among four brothers and
            one sister. He had a tough and poverty-ridden childhood and he also worked as a newspaper hawker to sustain
            his family’s expenses as well as his own studies.Mr. Kalam was average in studies during childhood but was
            known among teachers for having a strong desire to
            learn. He spent lots of time in studying, especially mathematics, the subject he loved.
            His initial schooling was done at Schwartz Higher Secondary School at Ramanathapuram after which he attended
            Saint Joseph’s college at Tiruchirappalli. From there he obtained a graduate degree in physics in 1954.
            Thereafter, Mr. Kalam got enrolled in the Madras Institute of Technology to study aerospace
            engineering.<br><br></p>

        <p><b>Career as a Scientist:</b><br><br>

            Mr. Kalam wanted to become a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force. After obtaining a degree in aerospace
            engineering from Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, he applied for becoming a fighter pilot in Air
            Force but missed the chance by just a whisker. He appeared ninth in the qualifier while there were only
            eight positions; perhaps destiny had something else in store for him.

            Even after so closely missing his life dream, Mr. Kalam didn’t lose faith in his abilities and became a
            scientist in DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation). It turned out that Mr. Kalam wasn’t very
            satisfied with his job at DRDO.

            In 1969 he was transferred to ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). Thereon he became the project
            director of India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), deploying successfully the Rohini satellite in
            1980.

            Apart from that, Kalam had also worked on several ballistic missile projects during 1970s to 1990s.
            Supported and funded by the union government, aerospace projects under the directorship of Mr. Kalam were
            highly successful bringing him name and fame during 1980s.

            Mr. Kalam had also served as the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister of India from July 1992 to
            December 1999. During this period he also served as the Director of the Defence Research and Development
            organization. He was also the Chief Project Coordinator of the Pokhran-II nuclear power test conducted in
            May 1998.</p><br><br>

        <p><b>Political Career:</b><br><br>

            Kalam’s name was first proposed for the President of India by the ruling NDA (National Democratic Alliance)
            government in June 2002. His candidature was backed by the other parties like the Indian National Congress
            and the Samajwadi Party.

            Former President, K.R. Narayanan also chose not to re-contest the Presidential election, making the field
            clear for Kalam. The only sole opponent of Kalam was a freedom fighter and Azad Hind Fauz veteran, Lakshmi
            Sehgal. Mrs. Sehgal; was backed by four leftist parties – the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist
            Party of India (Marxist)(CPI(M)), the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the All India Forward Bloc.

            However, the election was a one-sided affair due to the popularity and skills of Kalam. He won the 2002
            Presidential election, obtaining and an electoral vote of 922,884 against his opponent Lakshmi Sehgal’s
            107,366 votes.

            Kalam was sworn in as the 11th President of India on 25th July 2002 and his term ended on 25th July 2007.
